## Objectives

In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Step 1

### Scraping

Completed initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. 

[Jupyter Notebook File](Mission_to_Mars/mission_to_mars.ipynb)

## Step 2

### MongoDB and Flask Application

I used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

*[Scrape route](Mission_to_Mars/scrape_mars.py)

*[Root route](Mission_to_Mars/app.py)

*[HTML file](Mission_to_Mars/templates/index.html)
